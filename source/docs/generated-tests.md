## Generated Tests {#generated-tests}
For any controller action generated by Blueprint, a corresponding [HTTP Test](https://laravel.com/docs/http-tests) will be generated. Each test will contain _arrange_, _act_, and _assert_ code.

The _arrange_ section will set up any [model factories](https://laravel.com/docs/database-testing#using-factories), as well as [mock](https://laravel.com/docs/mocking) any of the underlying Facades used within the controller action.

Next, the _act_ section will send the appropriate HTTP request to the route with any parameters and request data for the controller action.

Finally, the _assert_ section will verify the response as well as the behavior for any mock.

While these tests are generated to be runnable out of the box, they are provided as a foundation. You should always review them for opportunities to strengthen their assertions and update them as you continue to write more code.

^^^
Blueprint generates PHPUnit tests by default. If you would to generate [Pest](https://pestphp.com/) tests instead, you may edit your [Blueprint config](/docs/advanced-configuration). Under the `generators` option, simply uncomment `\Blueprint\Generators\PestTestGenerator::class` and comment or remove `\Blueprint\Generators\PhpUnitTestGenerator::class`.
