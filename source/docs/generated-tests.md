## Generated Tests {#generated-tests}

Blueprint generates PHPUnit tests by default. If you would like it to generate [Pest PHP](https://pestphp.com/) tests instead, edit your [config](/docs/advanced-configuration) `blueprint.generators.test` to comment out `\Blueprint\Generators\PhpUnitTestGenerator::class` and uncomment `\Blueprint\Generators\PestTestGenerator::class`.

For any controller action generated by Blueprint, a corresponding [HTTP Test](https://laravel.com/docs/http-tests) will be generated. Each test will contain _arrange_, _act_, and _assert_ code.

The arrange section will set up any [model factories](https://laravel.com/docs/database-testing#using-factories), as well as [mock](https://laravel.com/docs/mocking) any of the underlying Facades used within the controller action.

Next, an act section will send the appropriate HTTP request to route with any parameters and request data for the controller action.

Finally, the assert section will verify the response as well as the behavior for any mock.

While these tests are generated to be runnable out of the box, they are provided as a foundation. You should always review them for opportunities to strengthen their assertions and update them as you continue to write more code.
