## Contributing to Blueprint {#contributing-to-blueprint}
Contributions may be made by submitting a Pull Request against the `master` branch.

Submitted PRs should:

- Explain the change, ideally using _before_ and _after_ examples.
- Include tests which verify the change.
- Pass all build steps.

You may also contribute by [opening an issue](https://github.com/laravel-shift/blueprint/issues) to report a bug or suggest a new feature. Or submit a Pull Request to improve the [Blueprint Documentation](https://github.com/laravel-shift/blueprint-docs).

If you are so inclined, you may also say "thanks" or proclaim your love of Blueprint [on X](https://www.x.com).
